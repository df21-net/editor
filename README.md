# Editor
This contains two Dark Forces Editor source codes.

1. Source code for Dark Forces Editor **DFUSE** from Summer 1995. It is the C version
2. Source code for Dark Forces Editor **WDFUSE** from 1997. It is the Delphi/Pascal version.
3. Source code for Outlaws Editor **LAWMAKER** from 1997. It is the Delphi/Pascal version.

The **DFUSE** code was provided on 5/18/2021 by Brad Oliver https://github.com/hoserama99 who used this codebase to build the Dark Forge editor for the Macintosh.

The **WDFUSE** code was provided on 5/22/2021 by Alexei Novikov https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexei-n-02313714a/ 

The **Lawmaker** code was provided on 5/31/2021 by Alexei Novikov https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexei-n-02313714a/ 
**Note:** While Lawmaker is an Outlaws editor, it is added here as it was built on top of **WDFUSE** and will help in debugging/investigating issues for Dark Forces editing.

Original Author is Yves Borckmans https://www.linkedin.com/in/deathangel/ It is kept on github for preservation purposes (and hopefully additional features). 

You can find the compiled Windows version of DFUSE over here https://df-21.net/downloads/util.php
