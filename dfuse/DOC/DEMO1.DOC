/* DFUSE DEMO 1 : simple texture stitching demo.                              */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

You start in a badly textured room in this mini level. Look at the normal walls
of the room, see how the Vs and inverted Vs don't match. Look at the stairs,
see how each step clashes violently. Look above the door, and see how the TOP
texture is misaligned.

Pass the door, and see how texturing can be improved by looking at the same
places in the other room.

It has been done very quickly, by multiselecting all the sectors on the 'good'
side, switching to WALLS mode, then pressing
    F5 to stitch MID textures horizontaly, then
Alt+F5 to stitch TOP textures horizontaly, then
    F7 to stitch MID vertically.

Then, the only non automatic one, the TOP texture above the door. Its Z offset
is simply 8. Easy isn't it ?

Note that textures have voluntarily be chosen to clash with each other, to
accentuate the defaults.

TO INSTALL IT
=============

Go to the DOS prompt, and type 'demo1-d! -d'.

DON'T FORGET THE '-d' or the level will be extracted in the wrong directory.

Be careful, this is a SECBASE replacement, and you risk to destroy any work you
have done on that level.

(note that extracted means 'from the PKZIP exe file' here, not from a .GOB)
