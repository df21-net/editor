/* DFUSE DEMO 2 : flags demo.                                                 */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

This mini-level has been designed to demonstrate the use of the flags.
Of course, all the flags aren't used, but you may find these :

SECTOR FLAGS
------------

1. sky                     (SC flag 1, 1)
2. normal door             (SC flag 1, 2)
3. fire-reflective         (SC flag 1, 4)
4. skating                 (SC flag 1, 16)
5. exploding door          (SC flag 1, 64)
6. killing ground slow     (SC flag 1, 2048)
7. killing ground fast     (SC flag 1, 4096)
8. secret                  (SC flag 1, 524288)   [NEW]

To easily find these, use the [F] key while in SECTORS mode.

WALL FLAGS
----------

1. force MID / transparent (WL flag 1, 1)
   in exploding_door and
   transparent_door
2. illuminated sign        (WL flag 1, 2)        [NEW]
   in illum_sign
3. show as normal on map   (WL flag 1, 2048)
   in exploding_door
4. cannot walk through     (WL flag 3, 2)
   on other/skating separation
5. cannot fire through     (WL flag 3, 8)
   on other/skating separation


Try them all, then modify the level to see what happen if you don't set them.
Also try the SC flag 1, bit 8 with different SKY sectors ceiling altitudes.
Try it on the transparent_door sector, just to see what happens to the MID tx.

Note that I have provided a few thermal detonators for the exploding_door.

TO INSTALL IT
=============

Go to the DOS prompt, and type 'demo2-d! -d'.

DON'T FORGET THE '-d' or the level will be extracted in the wrong directory.

Be careful, this is a SECBASE replacement, and you risk to destroy any work you
have done on that level.

(note that extracted means 'from the PKZIP exe file' here, not from a .GOB)
