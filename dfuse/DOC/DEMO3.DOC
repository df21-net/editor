/* DFUSE DEMO 3 : simple elevators.                                           */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

This mini-level has been designed to demonstrate the use of simple elevators.
Please see their description in the .INF file (press 'i' in LEVMAP).

You fill find:

1. A change_light elevator (in the 'change_light' sector), which simply
   pulsates the ambient light from 0 to 31 and back.

2. A simple platform that will elevate you 16 above the floor, then stay there
   for 10 seconds, before coming back down.
   Please note the use of the PEG TX ON VERTI MOVING WALL flag (WL 1, 16).
   To get a demo of its use, jump off the platform, then nudge it from outside.
   See how the texture moves 'naturally' with the wall. Now, do the same
   operation, but go and see the 'northen' side which has been 'forgotten'.
   Notice how this ISN'T natural!

3. Two scroll_floor elevators, the second working as a slave of the first.
   The second also has SC flag 1, 32768 set, so you won't follw the move !

4. A morph_spin2 elevator, which will allow you to spin wildly. Note that a
   morph_spin1 would have spun, but not you !

TO INSTALL IT
=============

Go to the DOS prompt, and type 'demo3-d! -d'.

DON'T FORGET THE '-d' or the level will be extracted in the wrong directory.

Be careful, this is a SECBASE replacement, and you risk to destroy any work you
have done on that level.

(note that extracted means 'from the PKZIP exe file' here, not from a .GOB)
