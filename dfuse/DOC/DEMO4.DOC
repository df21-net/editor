/* DFUSE DEMO 4 : simple triggers.                                            */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

This mini-level has been designed to demonstrate the use of triggers.
Please also see their description in the .INF file (press 'i' in LEVMAP).
It is based on demo3, so try that one first, as it will be easier to follow.

You fill find:

1. A trigger switch1, which enables the simple_platform elevator whose MASTER
   is OFF at startup. This is an essential thing to know.
   [Left wall]

2. A trigger switch1, which send next_stop messages to a variable_switch1
   elevator which alternate between two positions. This one sends messages
   to morphspin01 (master_on, master_off, master_on, ...). This in effect
   implements a toggle, but the switch always come back to its start 'color'.
   Note that a slight 0.25 s delay has been set up, so that you see that
   the switch really changes !
   [Right wall]

3. A real trigger toggle, which does the same as 2, but for the scroll1
   elevator. Here, the switch is and stays red when off, and green when on.
   [Bottom Left wall]

TO INSTALL IT
=============

Go to the DOS prompt, and type 'demo4-d! -d'.

DON'T FORGET THE '-d' or the level will be extracted in the wrong directory.

Be careful, this is a SECBASE replacement, and you risk to destroy any work you
have done on that level.

(note that extracted means 'from the PKZIP exe file' here, not from a .GOB)
