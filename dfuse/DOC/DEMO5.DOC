/* DFUSE DEMO 5 : multiple classes elevators                                  */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

This mini-level has been designed to demonstrate the use of multiple class
elevators.
Please also see their description in the .INF file (press 'i' in LEVMAP).
It is based on demo3, so try that one first, as it will be easier to follow.

You fill find:

1. A simple platform elevator, but with TWO CLASSES. It also acts as a sector
   TRIGGER which will enable the scroll1 elevator.

2. The morphspin01 elevator now also has FOUR CLASSES, all are ELEVATORS.
   It rotates AND its floor goes up and down AND its ceiling goes down and up
   AND change lights (moving it in the room it too much!)

TO INSTALL IT
=============

Go to the DOS prompt, and type 'demo5-d! -d'.

DON'T FORGET THE '-d' or the level will be extracted in the wrong directory.

Be careful, this is a SECBASE replacement, and you risk to destroy any work you
have done on that level.

(note that extracted means 'from the PKZIP exe file' here, not from a .GOB)
