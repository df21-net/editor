/* DFUSE DEMO 6 : second altitudes                                            */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

This mini-level has been designed to demonstrate the use of second altitudes.

You fill find:

1. A platform at 12 in height => this give its underlying sector a second
   altitude of -12. I also made 2 gaps (the big columns from floor to ceiling)
   this is to hide the platform extremities which aren't textured by the game.
   Remove one of the gaps to see what I mean. A simple elevator has been created
   for you to be able to go up there. Notice that you can walk ON the platform,
   AND UNDER it.

2. A simple river sector which has a second altitude of 4 (ie you are 4 deep).
   Notice that this is sufficient to make it waterlike (ie the splash and
   the weapon impacts). A little scroll_floor elevator has been created to
   first give it a 'moving' look and second simulate current.


TO INSTALL IT
=============

Go to the DOS prompt, and type 'demo6-d! -d'.

DON'T FORGET THE '-d' or the level will be extracted in the wrong directory.

Be careful, this is a SECBASE replacement, and you risk to destroy any work you
have done on that level.

(note that extracted means 'from the PKZIP exe file' here, not from a .GOB)
