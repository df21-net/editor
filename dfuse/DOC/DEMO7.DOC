/* DFUSE DEMO 7 : how to use teleporter chutes ?                              */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

This mini-level has been designed to demonstrate the use of teleporter chutes.
Please see their description in the .INF file (press 'i' in LEVMAP).

You fill find:

Two teleporter chutes marked start00 and start01. Their respective target
sectors are target00 and target01.

To use a chute, simply place the target below the ground, but you must provide
sufficient room to fall through (ie around 8 units will do).

It is very important to note that the two part levels may occupy the
SAME PHYSICAL place !


TO INSTALL IT
=============

Go to the DOS prompt, and type 'demo7-d! -d'.

DON'T FORGET THE '-d' or the level will be extracted in the wrong directory.

Be careful, this is a SECBASE replacement, and you risk to destroy any work you
have done on that level.

(note that extracted means 'from the PKZIP exe file' here, not from a .GOB)
