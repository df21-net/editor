You will find the doc for this one in its .INF file.

[NEW] As I now know all the flags, the conversion is more exact that the v 0.90
version and includes the secrets and a correct scroll_wall elevator instead of
an approximate morph_spin.

TO INSTALL IT (it take around 700K)
=============

Go to the DOS prompt, and type 'de1m1-d! -d'.

DON'T FORGET THE '-d' or the level will be extracted in the wrong directory.

Be careful, this is a SECBASE replacement, and you risk to destroy any work you
have done on that level, or on the TEXT.MSG file that will also be extracted in
your DARK directory.

A lot of textures (.BM) will be extracted in your TEXTURES directory. If you
haven't made textures that match the DOOM textures names, it won't be a
problem. If you have created new textures and want to be sure, you can type

'PKUNZIP de1m1-d!.exe dfudata\textdoom.dfu'

to get a list of the files that will be extracted.

(note that extracted means 'from the PKZIP exe file' here, not from a .GOB)
