 II.   A SHORT TOUR OF THE MENUS


 0.    OVERVIEW
       ========

DFUSE is a collection of utilities to modify / create Dark Forces levels.
Its heart is the DFUSE.EXE program which is a multilevel menu system.
As you have seen in the readme.1st file, conventionnal memory is an important
issue, so DFUSE relies heavily on external executables. Those are:

   * LEVMAP.EXE    a full featured multilayered geometry and objects editor
                   with viewers to allow graphical texturing and object
                   selection.
   * GOBINFO.EXE   a GOB file directory lister, also capable of generating
                   batches for FEXTRACT
   * DIR2GOB.EXE   a tool to construct a GOB from the contents of a directory.
   * GOBMAKE.EXE   a tool to reconstruct an extracted GOB from a
                   'mygob.gom' make file and a 'MYGOB.GOX' directory.
   * FEXTRACT.EXE  a general purpose 'part of file' extractor
   * xxxVIEW.EXE   BM, FME and WAX viewers
   * BM2BMP.EXE    a .BM to .BMP convertor

Note that you will also find a few other utilities which haven't been
integrated in the DFUSE menus.

   * HEX.EXE       a general purpose HEX editor which lacks sophistication
                   but does the job
   * DARKHACK.EXE  will 'hack' your darkpilo.cfg file to give access to all
                   the levels and give you all weapons, ...
   * BMP2BM.EXE    will convert 256 colors .BMP files to .BM
                   If you use .BMP extracted with BM2BMP and worked upon in a
                   tool that 'respects' its palette (PhotoStyler is great)
                   you won't have problems. Else, try it and see the results
                   as my palette conversion is a bit lame.
                   You may also try a few settings in the [BMP2BM-RGB] section
                   of DFUSE.INI, but without any guarantee !
                   Does somebody have an algorithm to do that correctly ?
   * MKSW_4_4.EXE  this will create a 32x32 switch from two 32x32 BMs, and an
                   existing switch.
   * GOB2DFU.BAT   is a simple batch file that accept a gobfile as parameter
                   (without the .GOB extension !) and extract it in the
                   correct directories. This has been added quickly for
                   convenience, and will be made into a DFUSE menu later.
                   CAUTION : there is NO protection for any level you are
                             working upon; if the .GOB patches the same level,
                             your work WILL BE DESTROYED !!!
   * OFFSTVUE.EXE  this will offset the absolute coordinates used in a .VUE
                   file, so you will be able to use it any place. Type
                   OFFSTVUE without any parameters to get a command line
                   description.
   * LFDINFO.EXE   a LFD file directory lister, also capable of generating
                   batches for FEXTRACT. [NEW]
   * FILMINFO.EXE  a FILM resource lister. [NEW]


I won't take much time explaining how to use DFUSE as I think the menu items
are quite self explanatory. You will however find a short explanation of the
directory tree that DFUSE needs, as well as a brief description of the menus.
You should also read the df_specs.doc file which contains essential information.


 I.    DIRECTORY TREE
       ==============

DFUSE uses a quite complicated directory tree to try and keep a lot of data
organized.
Warning : DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THESE DIRECTORIES (except the .GOX) !!!
Let's say you have installed in \DFUSE.

\DFUSE
      \DFUDATA
      \DOC

      \DARK
      \SOUNDS
      \SPRITES
      \TEXTURES

      \GOBDATA
              \DARK.GOX
              \SOUNDS.GOX
              \SPRITES.GOX
              \TEXTURES.GOX

      \BACKUPS
      \TEMP

      \DFUTEST
      \DFUPLUS

      \DFUGRAPH


0. DFUSE
   -----
   This directory contains all the executables.
   A VERY important file here is DFUSE.INI which contains a lot of settings for
   ALL the programs (except HEX). So, even if all is working perfectly, you may
   want to allocate a bit more memory to vertices in the level editor, or
   decide to have your WAX viewer in 320x200, or ...
   You'll find a LOT of documented settings there, and the info you entered at
   install time may be fine tuned.

   A quick note on !DFUSE.BAT: as DFUSE includes a DOS Shell option, it is very
   easy to relaunch DFUSE from the shell, or from another DOS box if using
   Windows or OS/2. I implemented a little safeguard for those of you that
   do that kind of things. Of course, those of you using SHARE.EXE will be
   greeted by a 'Sharing violation on drive x:' before !
   When DFUSE starts, it will check for a file named DFUSE.RUN and will exit
   with a message telling you that DFUSE is already running. If it doesn't
   find the file, then it creates it, runs normally, and destroy it at exit.
   The problem is that DFUSE won't have the chance to clean it up if the PC
   crashes for any reason. So the next time, the file will be there and DFUSE
   won't start.  !DFUSE.BAT will simply remove the file and start DFUSE.EXE .


1. DFUDATA
   -------
   This directory will contain data used internally by the programs. I tried to
   use an open approach, and this will let you modify the lists of values.

   This has a little drawback: if you create a new texture, it won't be in the
   lists automatically. However, I think that sorting the data as you like it is
   much more important. Also note that you can set things like *DOOR64x64*
   in the lists to set headers (do not make it longer than a filename however).

2. DOC
   ---
   All doc files, except the readme.1st file which is in the main directory.

3. DARK (and SOUNDS, SPRITES and TEXTURES)
   ----
   These are the patch directories. What you put there will normally be copied
   to your installed game directory when you test the level or included in
   testlevl.gob . And, following the patch rules, will be used by the game.

   DARK     may contain: levels, .3DO files, jedi.lvl and text.msg
   SOUNDS       ''     : any .VOC or .GMD files
   SPRITES      ''     : any .FME or .WAX files
   TEXTURES     ''     : any .BM file

   If you put something else in those directories, it won't be copied.
   (That's the purpose of the DFUPLUS directory !)
   Also, DFUSE will only copy the currently selected level.

   Please note that the [G] Single .GOB Extract option in DFUSE will extract
   in these directories (as opposed to the [F] Full .GOB Extract which will
   use the GOBDATA directories).

4. GOBDATA
   -------
   This will contain the results of the 'Full GOB Extract' option. So,
   if you choose to fully extract say 'dark.gob', a DARK.GOX directory and a
   DARK.GOM 'makefile' will be created. If you choose to reconstruct a GOB,
   it will also be there.
   Please note that .GOB are HUGE files so watch your disk space.

5. BACKUPS
   -------
   The level editor will create a copy of the current .LEV, .O, .GOL and .INF
   files there before saving. So if you make a big mistake...
   Please note that the copies will be named backup.LEV, etc. so only one
   level can be backed up.

6. TEMP
   ----
   All the programs use this directory for temporary files. If DFUSE isn't
   running, you may delete everything you find there (ie after a crash).

7. DFUTEST
   -------
   DFUSE reserves DFUTEST for preparing the testlevl.gob file when testing.
   Warning: the contents of this directory are cleared by DFUSE.

7. DFUPLUS
   -------
   Anything you put into DFUPLUS will be either included in testlevl.gob
   or copied to the [INSTALLED] directory when testing the level.
   This allow you to include things DFUSE doesn't normally handle.

   We could also try to use a level information file (something like GOB.NFO)
   with a determined (text?) format, to be included in all patch 'GOB's.
   So all of us who made GOB information programs would make a small update,
   and the users will have level author, which level it replaces,... displayed.
   If this interest all of you level and tools makers, mail me to discuss it!

   In the mean time, I borrowed the widely available WAD_AUTH.TXT file,
   modified it a little and renamed it GOB_AUTH.TXT . Fill it up before
   distributing your level.

   If someone in particular is responsible for WAD_AUTH, I give him full
   credits.


9. DFUGRAPH
   --------
   (please consider this one reserved for 'future extensions' as I'm planning
    to reorganize the conversions of BM, FME and WAX to and from BMP, as well
    as automating switches and animated textures creation)

Note: if you are limited in disk space (who isn't ?) you should take a little
      care because DFUSE sessions can generate a LOT of data. Let's say that
      you are going to do a modification to the DTENTION level. It's your first
      time on that one, so when you select the level DFUSE will extract it.
      You go to the editor and make changes, then save. The editor will make a
      copy in the BACKUPS directory. Then you exit, come back to DFUSE, and use
      the 'Test Level' option. The level will be copied to the installed game
      directory to serve as patch.

      So? Well this makes you 3 copies of DTENTION and totals around 3 Megs.
      And you have 14 levels in the original game !

      Also, if you use 'Full .GOB Extract' know that DARK.GOB for instance
      GOBbles up 14 Megs !


 II.   A SHORT TOUR OF THE MENUS
       =========================

The main menu of DFUSE will present you the following screen:

                     +------------------------------+
                     |  DFUSE Main MENU version     |
                     |         copyright            |
                     +------------------------------+
                     |  [F].  Full   .GOB Extract   |
                     |  [G].  Single .GOB Extract   |
                     |  [L].  Levels  Menu          |
                     |  [T].  Special Text Files    |
                     |  [V].  Viewers Menu          |
                     |                              |
                     |  [X].  Launch DF             |
                     |                              |
                     |  [Z].  OS Shell              |
                     | [Esc]  Exit DFUSE            |
                     +------------------------------+

This is a typical DFUSE menu, and works simply by typing the letter enclosed
in '[]' at the start of the line. Pressing Esc will exit DFUSE in this menu,
and bring you back to the parent menu in the others.

From now on, I won't repeat the OS Shell and ESC lines, nor the (c) line.

1.  [F].  Full   .GOB Extract
    -------------------------

This will bring you to the full .GOB extraction menu.

                     +------------------------------+
                     |       Full .GOB Extract      |
                     +------------------------------+
                     | [E].  Edit GOM file          |
                     | [I].  GOB info               |
                     | [M].  GOB make (reconstruct) |
                     | [X].  GOB extract            |
                     +------------------------------+

When you want to extract from a .GOB, you may get a listing of its directory
with the GOB info function. It will present you with a list of the GOBs, and
you choose one of them.

The GOB extract function works the same, letting you choose one of the GOBs,
then extracting it in a gobname.GOX directory under GOBDATA. This will also
generate a gobname.GOM file, containing a snapshot of the GOB directory entries
at extract time. This file can be edited, then used as a 'makefile' for the
GOB make function, possibly with addons and deletions. Please note that you
normally don't need to do this at all.


2.  [G].  Single .GOB Extract
    -------------------------

This will bring you to the single .GOB extraction menu.

                     +------------------------------+
                     |      Single .GOB Extract     |
                     +------------------------------+
                     | [J].  Extract JEDI.LVL       |
                     | [L].  Extract a Level        |
                     | [T].  Extract TEXT.MSG       |
                     | [X].  Extract Single File    |
                     +------------------------------+

You can use the [J] and [T] functions to reextract to important text files.
The [L] function will (re)extract a full level.
Warning: use it carefully as this may destroy your work on a level!

Finally, the [X] function will let you extract any single file from any .GOB .


3.  [L].  Levels menu
    -----------------

This is probably the most important menu !
The first time you come to this menu, it will present itself this way:

                     +------------------------------+
                     |      DFUSE Levels MENU       |
                     +------------------------------+
                     | [C].  CHOOSE LEVEL !!        |
                     +------------------------------+

DFUSE is asking you to select a level to work upon. So press the 'C' key, and
select in the list that appears. Afterwards, the menu will appear as this:

                     +------------------------------+
                     |      DFUSE Levels MENU       |
                     +------------------------------+
                     | [C].  Change from 'levelname'|
                     | [I].  Edit .INF              |
                     | [G].  Edit .GOL              |
                     | [L].  Edit .LEV (Txt)        |
                     | [M].  Edit .LEV (Map)        |
                     | [O].  Edit .O                |
                     | [P].  View Palette           |
                     | [T].  Test Level             |
                     +------------------------------+

[C] will let you change to another level, possibly extracting it from DARK.GOB
if it hasn't been extracted yet.

The [I], [G], [L] and [O] functions let you edit or list the corresponding
files, depending of the [SECURITY] section of your DFUSE.INI config file.

[P] will display the palette of the currently selected level. Note that this
correspond to levelname.PAL, and NOT to the 'PALETTE' entry in the LEV file.

[T] will prepare to test the level by
    * creating testlevl.gob and copying it to your installed game directory,
 OR * copying all the necessary files to your installed game directory,

and launching Dark Forces.

The method of testing is set in DFUSE.INI in the [DFUSE-TESTMETHOD] section.
The default is TEST_AS_GOB=1 which is the .GOB method.

Note that when your level is ready, you just have to rename the testlevl.gob
file to something more relevant (and ZIP it !) to distribute it.

Finally, [M] will start the level editor (LEVMAP.EXE), so see the levmap.doc
file for that one.

4.  [T].  Special Text Files
    ------------------------

This will simply offer two choices to edit the JEDI.LVL and the TEXT.MSG files.

                     +------------------------------+
                     |       DFUSE Text MENU        |
                     +------------------------------+
                     | [J].  Edit JEDI.LVL          |
                     | [T].  Edit TEXT.MSG          |
                     +------------------------------+

5.  [V].  Viewers Menu
    ------------------

This one will let you select the type of viewer, offering you to choose between
four different viewers: BM, FME, WAX and VOC
(of course, it's more of a 'listener' in that last case).
Note that the first three viewers come from DFUSE itself, but for the fourth
(VOC) you'll have to setup a VOCPLAYER in DFUSE.INI . The one that comes with
my SoundBlaster is perfect, I don't know for other sound cards.

                     +------------------------------+
                     |     DFUSE Viewers MENU       |
                     +------------------------------+
                     | [B].  .BM  Menu (Textures)   |
                     | [F].  .FME Menu (Frames)     |
                     | [V].  .VOC Menu (Sounds)     |
                     | [W].  .WAX Menu (Sprites)    |
                     +------------------------------+

They are all very similar, so I'll show only the .BM viewer.

                     +------------------------------+
                     |       DFUSE .BM  MENU        |
                     +------------------------------+
                     |Current .BM directory is :    |
                     | (directory)                  |
                     |Current .PAL for [V] & [2] is |
                     | (palette)                    |
                     | [C].  Change .BM directory   |
                     | [I].  Edit  DFUSE.INI        |
                     | [P].  Change .PAL            |
                     | [V].  View .BM               |
                     | [2].  .BM -> .BMP            |
                     +------------------------------+

I think this is all very straightforward. Just remember you can change graphic
mode and .BGI for the viewers separately in DFUSE.INI .

Note that the BM viewer has conversion to .BMP, and that the VOC 'viewer' has
conversion to .WAV (if you have set the correct tool in DFUSE.INI).
