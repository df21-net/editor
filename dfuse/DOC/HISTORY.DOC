Release v 1.00 : 04/06/1995.

* Added a little batch file GOB2DFU.BAT which will take a GOB and extract its
  contents in the correct directories for DFUSE.
  Note: pass the file name without the .GOB extension and be CAREFUL !

* Implemented two checks on the sectors:
   - #vx = #wl
   - Floor <= Ceiling

* Implemented three checks on the objects:
   - OB not in SC
   - OB in deleted SC
   - NO player start, or more than 1

* Implemented object layering. Toggle = Alt + O.
  Got the sector floor_alt and ceili_alt back in main memory from the swap file,
  as object layering made a random order use of them, and was too slow.
  There is an entry in DFUSE.INI to completely disable object layering if you
  are making pure geometry work.

* Implemented much better sector and wall selection.
  It is now near perfect, the only problem arising when two sectors overlap
  ON THE SAME LAYER.
  The select next nearest SC and next nearest WL (ie Ctl + LEFT BUTTON) have
  been removed. Next nearest VX is still there.

* Implemented POLYGON generation (key: 'K')
  Implemented GAP-POLYGON generation. (key: Alt + K)
  Implemented GAP-POLYGON + POLYGON in GAP generation. (key: Ctl + K)

* Implemented deformations on (multi)selections (key: 'D'):
   - Translate, Scale, Rotate OK
   - Sector flipping still a little 'strange' :)

* Implemented multiple copy of objects and sectors.
  You may have still have to correct the INF, or at least reread it.

* Implemented INF reading, both at startup and after editing it.
  Elevators and triggers (sector and line) have different colors.
  The doors which are coded at the flag level are marked as elevators.
  Secrets sectors have a different color.
  If a sector combines these, LEVMAP will use the following order :
  line trigger, then secrets, then sector trigger, then elevator.
  Note that this modifies DFUSE.INI !

* Implemented 0 1 2 3 keys which will show : ALL / EASY / MED / HARD objects.

* Added 'f' or 'F' key which will find the PLAYER start in object mode.

* Objects now have different colors depending on what they are. This feature
  uses the DFUDATA\OB_COLS.DFU file as data. Objects encoded there will have
  their own color, others will use the default object color.
  The file is a .INI in disguise, so it is very easy to understand.

* Objects now have a different look depending on their class.
  Spirits are 'X', safes are 'S', 3D are '3', frames are 'circles',
  sounds are 'V' and sprites are 'squares' (except GENERATORs which are
  noted 'G').

* Implemented automatic creation of 'object sequences' and GENERATORs in the
  OBJECT editor. This uses the DFUDATA\OB_SEQS.DFU file as data.

* Added a Log: entry in the object editor. This shows the first LOGIC: in the
  object sequences (ie in 99.9% of the cases the important one). This allows
  important distinctions between different SPIRITS (most notably the player),
  and between different objects type based on the same 'viewable file'
  (most notably the GENERATORs). 

* The cursor keys are now emulated with the mouse. Just put the pointer
  completely against the side of the screen, then click (and optionally hold)
  the LEFT mouse button.

* Cleaned up the new walls when inserting a sector GAP. Copies data from wall 1
  instead of 0 (as 0 is often a door), then clears all the flags, all the
  offsets, and any sign.

* Corrected a slight fault that gave occasional hangups when viewing the
  ZPGRYFIL.BM texture. (That one is 1x1 !)

* Corrected a bug in the 'C'hange TX list (SC and WL editors) which caused a
  loss of the modifications made before pressing 'C'.

* Corrected a slight bug that caused multiple edition display color to revert
  to single edition display color when editing object SEQs.

Release v 0.91 : 06/05/1995.

* Added the DIR2GOB.EXE tool and the .gob level testing method (-u).
  Note that this modifies DFUSE.INI !

* Corrected SC FLAG 1 from unsigned to unsigned long.

* Quickened the map refresh by not drawing the shadow and the grid if there are
  keys waiting in the keyboard buffer. The current layer, multiselection and
  selection are still always drawn. This may leave an uncomplete shadow or
  grid on the screen when entering an editor, but the gain of speed is worth it.

* Implemented splitting of wall with adjoin. (And it's a lenghty operation !)

* Added multiple textures picklists.
  This hasn't been done for objects for now, if someone finds it useful...

* Corrected a little bug in LEVMAP's internal FME and WAX viewers which caused
  incorrect display of patch FME or WAX.

Release v 0.90 : 29/04/1995.
