Let's begin.


HOW DO I CREATE A COMPLETELY NEW LEVEL ?
======================================

Quit DFUSE totally.

At the DOS prompt, type "cd dark" to go to the DFUSE\DARK subdirectory.
This contains - among other things - the levels you are working upon.
Ok, now type "newlevl!". This will create six files named NEWLEVEL.LEV,
NEWLEVEL.O, NEWLEVEL.INF, NEWLEVEL.GOL, NEWLEVEL.CMP and NEWLEVEL.PAL. These
six files together are a complete Dark Forces level. However, due to some
information beeing hardcoded in the game, you have to rename them to the exact
name of an already existing level. Let's use the first one : SECBASE.

If you have already worked on a SECBASE replacement, you may want to backup
you files. Type "md sec_back" to create a directory to save your old work.
Then, type "move secbase.* sec_back" to move all the secbase files to this
safe place.

If you haven't already worked on a SECBASE replacement, type "del secbase.*"
to be sure you haven't extracted the level unknowingly.

Ok, now type "ren newlevel.* secbase.*". The six files will be renamed to
SECBASE.LEV, SECBASE.O, SECBASE.INF, SECBASE.GOL, SECBASE.CMP and SECBASE.PAL.

We now have a new level to work upon. Remember, this hasn't been automated
for your own security. I wouldn't advise to create a batch file with all those
DOS commands. Make an habit of making a ceremony of this, after all next time
you'll be doing this you'll just have finished a level :)

Right now, we are going to see what we just created, so ...


HOW DO I LAUNCH THE MAP EDITOR ?
==============================

If you have been following along, type "cd .." to get back to the main DFUSE
directory.

Type "dfuse" to launch the main shell. If the program stops immediately with
an error telling you that 'DFUSE is already running', then stop reading now
and see the 'DFUSE IS ALREADY RUNNING' ERROR MESSAGE entry.

You should now see DFUSE Main MENU. There are a lot of things there, but what
interests us now is to go and see our new level, so press the "L" key to
activate the "[L].  Levels  Menu" item.

Now we are at the Levels MENU. The only relevant option is
"[C].  Choose Level  !!", so press the "C" key. A picklist appears, with the
first line selected. The selection is already on the level that interest us :
SECBASE. So just press the "Enter" key to select it.

We are now back at the Levels MENU. Notice how a lot of options have appeared
since you selected a level. We are in a hurry to see our new level now, so
press the "M" key to activate the "[M]. Edit .LEV (Map)" item.

Right! A lot of things should flash on the screen, including a copyright
notice, then progress bars. Depending on your computer speed, you may not even
have the time to see them. Don't bother, you'll have all the time to examine
them when your level will grow, and LEVMAP (this is the map editor) will take
more time to load it.

What you should have on the screen now is three geometric shapes : a kind of
'C', a kind of 'O', and a square. You should also see big blue boxes on top of
the screen, and the mouse cursor. If you don't, then you have a problem.

If you own a 486sx PC, the most probable problem is that you are running the
normal LEVMAP.EXE, and not the special 'sx' version. If this is the case, see
the WHAT IF I HAVE A 486sx ? entry.

If all is correct, but you don't see the mouse cursor, then refer to your mouse
manual to learn how to load your mouse driver. In most cases, you just have to
type "mouse". You must however do this out of DFUSE, so press the "Esc" key
until you are at the DOS prompt, then do what you must to have your mouse
driver up and running, then follow the instructions in this section again.

Still here ?

Now, "What's all this stuff ?" I hear you saying, "I thought we just created
a completely new level".

Well, first the 'C' thing is a "complete sector".
This sector (named "complete") is mandatory in a DF level. Without entering
complex INF details now, this sector is a special elevator whose position
represent the goals accomplished in the level by the player.

The 'O' thing is an object 'supermarket'. As you will rapidly see, LEVMAP
works by creating copies of things, so this is a repository of frequently used
objects.

The square will be the first 'usable' sector in our level. It is red, which
means that it is the currently selected thing.
We'll come back to it in a moment, but first we'll explore a little...


HOW DO I SWITCH MODES, AND ZOOM, AND SCROLL THE MAP ?
===================================================

First of all, what are modes ?

There are a lot of things in a Dark Forces level, and LEVMAP only handles
the geometry (LEV) and the objects (O). It also allow a visual coding of what's
in the INF.

Objects are easy to understand. They include the ennemies, the weapons,
the powerups, and so on.

The geometry is a bit more complicated. For now, remember this :
Dark Forces levels are a 'world' in which the player will evolve. This world
is geometrically described using VERTICES (plural of VERTEX) as points, having
coordinates.

A WALL is defined as a line between two VERTICES.

A SECTOR is something more difficult to explain :
"an horizontal (east-west and north-south) area of the
 map where a floor height and ceiling height is defined.  It can
 have any shape.  Any change in floor or ceiling height or texture
 requires a new sector (and therefore separating walls)."
 [Matt Fell, Unauthorized DOOM Specs]

Let's just say for now that a SECTOR is an area enclosed by WALLS.

So, back to the modes : as the OBJECTS, VERTICES, WALLS and SECTORS all have
their properties, and different visual representations, LEVMAP has 4 states
or MODES, being in effect 4 editors in one.

Press the "O" key. Shazam! We are in OBjects mode.
What has changed ?

Well, nearly everything. The information in the big blue boxes at the top of
the screen now refer to objects. Our square isn't red anymore because it isn't
the selected thing anymore! Color dots have appeared, two in the square, and
a lot in the supermarket.

Tiny isn't it ? Ok, let's learn another thing here : ZOOMing. Move your mouse
pointer roughly in the middle of the supermarket, and press the "C" key.
This will ZOOM and CENTER the screen on the cursor. Other useful ZOOM keys
are "+" and "-".

So, what do we see ?

As you already guessed, there are different colors and different shapes of
objects.

Blue ones are ennemies, the lighter the stronger.
Browns/yellows are powerups, the lighter the more useful.
Pinks are goal objects and keys, etc.
Grays are neutral/scenery objects.

Squares are Sprites, O are Frames, 3 are 3DO, S are Safes, V are Sounds...
Whatdidhesay ?
These are multiple classes of objects, we'll come back to them later.

We will however learn about a very special object right now : the PLAYER.

Show the square sector again. Use the cursors to bring it to the center of
the screen. Unzoom the MAP (remember, the "-" key) a little, this will be
easier. Zoom again on the square.

There are two objects in there. Focus on the green X. If it isn't selected
(ie if it hasn't a red circle around it) put you mouse pointer on it and
click the LEFT button.

This is a MANDATORY object. If you don't put a player start in your level,
Dark Forces will CRASH when you load the level, and you'll have to reboot.
This is true even if you are running some supposedly 'crash-protected' OS.

By the way, observe the red line that starts at the object. It is a visual
representation of the object's YAW (orientation). In this very special case,
it shows the line of sight of the player when the game starts.

Press the "S" key to return to SECTOR mode, because we are now going to study
the geometry elements.

WHAT GEOMETRIC REPRESENTATION DOES LEVMAP USE ?
