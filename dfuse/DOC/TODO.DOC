TO DO LIST / WISH LIST

Author   : Yves  BORCKMANS  (yborckmans@abcomp.be (work))

If you use and like this product, feel free to contact me for suggestions.
Don't forget to state the package version.

Here is the current list, in no special order (but + means greater priority):

+ Complete the specs ASAP.
  I need you all for this, if you find new info, SHARE it !

  Also, if someone at LEC is reading this and is willing to help, I could use:
   . a formal definition for the INF and O languages
   . a description of the int values after the texture offsets
       this is the last unknown data in the LEV file !
   . a description of the last 128 bytes of .CMP files
   . a description of the first header of a .FME file
   . a full description of the .WAX files

  Thanks in advance.

+ Implement .INF file checking:
   . sector must exist for elevators, triggers, client and slaves.
   . wall   must exist for triggers.

+ Make some menus, as we are approaching 80 key combos.

* Implement a snapshot of the screen as BMP.

? Implement multiple split and delete of walls. (would be VERY slow !)

* Implement sector splitting.

* Correct the texture stitching so that it handles the SIGNs.
  This is difficult to do, as the user will normally set an offset for the
  SIGN. Should I add that offset ? What about the second time the user stitches?

* Texture a few walls, and propagate to all the walls of the sector,
  with automatic offsets for MID, TOP and BOT textures. This one should
  understand how to align TOP textures above doors, when the textures change,
  etc. (is this a dream ?)

+ Implement a correct palette mapper for the BM conversions, so that we can
  really make new textures.
  Does somebody have a correct algorithm for this ?

+ Create tools to make switches and animated textures.
  (like mksw_4_4.exe but much more user friendly, probably with text make files
   Something like
      SWITCH: name
       ON:     sw1.bm
       OFF:    sw2.bm
   and
      ANI_TX: name
      SPEED:  s
      BEGIN
       01:     ani1.bm
       02:     ani2.bm
       ...
        n:     anin.bm
      END
  )

* Create FME <-> BMP convertor.

* Create WAX <-> FME extractor and importer OR WAX generation from make files.

* Make a .3DO viewer with or without texturing.

* Make a 3D map viewer, without texturing, but with the possibility to
  show or hide layers and to zoom/rotate it.

If you have made one of these last two, and want to share it, email me,
so that we can talk about integrating it in the package.
