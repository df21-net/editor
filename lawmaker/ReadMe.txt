Howdy, pardner! You got a hankering for level editing?

Here's something for you - the first beta of LawMaker,
the editor for Outlaws ((c) 1997 by LucasArts).  LawMaker
is based on WDFUSE (Dark Forces editor by Yves Borkmans).
It runs on Windows 95 or Windows NT only (since Outlaws
is a Windows 95 application anyway).

Getting started.

The procedure is marginally simple - unzip the archive
to the directory of your choice and run it. You'll be 
presented with the options dialog asking you to specify 
the game directory (the directory you installed Outlaws 
to) and the drive that has Outlaws CD in it. Do it and 
click OK. You're ready to do some editing. 

	If you're are new to Outlaws editing,  first read 
the LawMaker help. If you edited Dark Forces or even used 
WDFUSE, be  sure to check out the section "To WDFUSE users".
