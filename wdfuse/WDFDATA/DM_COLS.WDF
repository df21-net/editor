# If the object isn't encoded here, it will be Gray (ie color of shadow).
# The convention I adopted is blue for ennemies (lighter = harder),
# green for weapons (light) and ammo (dark)
# and yellow for useful things (lighter = more useful).
# Keys and goal items are pink, and 'true spirits' are light green.
