Chromas Mines is a palette and color map editor for Dark Forces - a classic Star Wars FPS. If you're not familiar with it, go visit www.df-21.net, which is the home base of the Dark Forces community.

Just unpack all the files to any folder and run the cm.exe.
See its tutorial by clicking on Help -> Tutorial in the app menu. It leads to the tutorial video.

Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows.

Freeware - feel free to distribute as much as you want, but keep the files unmodified. And don't sell it. Giving something back to the community that has afforded me so much fun in the past...

Have fun.
